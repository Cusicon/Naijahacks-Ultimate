# Project name: Inspect

**Inspect** is a secured and comfortable revolutionary exam app for schools conducting student exams

## **What Inspirired me**

I went for an exam a certain day, weigh far from home. That day was a stressful and really annoying day. Then the exam, it came to me, why can't I write the exam at home and not waste transport to go that far? then that was the conceiving of the idea.

## **What it does**

It helps students far and near to effortlessly take exams in their comfort zone, anywhere and everywhere.
The school's admins, teacher or anyone assigned for the examination inspection ( **_Inspectors_** ) will be able to watch the student while writing the exam.
it is highly secured and comfortable.

## **How we built it**

It was on this hackathon that I saw an awesome team that helped me to accomplish this outstanding idea.

## **Challenges we ran into**

This wasn't easy because I had to do some testing and I and my team were far away from each other, but with the help of technologies, we conquered all the challenges and difficulties.

## **Accomplishments that we're proud of**

I'm proud of my team and my team I, we are so happy that we could be able to finish this revolutionary app for demo.

## **What we learned**

I have learned a lot through the duration of this project, but what I learn most is, working with a team is a lot more fun, helpful, stress releasing and full of hope than working all alone.

## **What's next for Inspect**

By the Grace of God, we win the **Educational Category** of this Hackathon (Naijahacks2019) and **get funded**, we will make sure the best version of **Inspect** will be used all over Africa as the Official local and international online examination portal.
